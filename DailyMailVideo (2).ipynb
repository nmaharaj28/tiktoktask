    "concept2 = \"Code 1 if comments discourages Taylor Swift from suing Donald Trump, but Code 0 for everything else.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "These concepts changed heavily throughout the coding. They become much more specific, defining what specific emojis meant and what constituted a comment as being pro or anti Trump or Swift. Ultimately, we decided to keep the concepts to just the conversation surrounding the actual lawsuit. \n",

    "or Concept 1:\n",
    "Code “1” for Concept 1 if the comment clearly expresses ANY of the following: Support, praise, or defense of Taylor Swift in the context of suing Trump, Agreement that Taylor Swift should sue, is right to sue, or has grounds to sue, if comments are happy that Swift is suing, are urging Swift to Sue, and have declared support for Swift suing Trump, criticism of Donald Trump that implies Swift is justified in taking legal action, Criticism of Donald Trump that implies Swift is justified in taking legal action, Positive statements about Swift’s character, intentions, or actions related to the dispute, Mocking or dismissing Trump in a way that indicates Swift is correct\n",
    "Code “0” for Concept 1 if: The comment discourages Swift from suing, The comment is neutral, unclear, off-topic, vague, or contains only emojis or filler text (e.g., “fyp,” “lol,” “???”), The comment discusses the situation without taking a side.​ the comment is unrelated to the Swift–Trump lawsuit discussion. Code 0 if the comment claims that Swift must sue anyone who uses her music now, implying that Swift is being dramatic for suing Trump. \n",
    "For Concept 2: \n",
    "Code “1” for Concept 2 if the comment clearly expresses ANY of the following:, Support, praise, or defense of Donald Trump in the context of the lawsuit, Statements suggesting Swift is overreacting, dramatic, unreasonable, or “needs to calm down”, Claims that Swift shouldn’t sue, has no case, or is being excessive, Mocking Swift or her fans in the context of the lawsuit, claiming that Swift must sue anyone who uses her music now.\n",
    "Code “0” for Concept 2 if: The comment supports Swift, The comment is neutral, unclear, sarcastic without explicit wording, or off-topic, The comment contains only emojis or filler text, The comment criticizes both sides equally​, The comment discusses politics or celebrities in general without referencing the lawsuit\n",

    "Important Clarification Rules for both concepts: \n",
    "A comment can receive two zeros if it supports neither side.\n",
    "If a comment is ambiguous, vague, or does not explicitly take a stance, code both concepts as 0.\n",
    "Political comments not related to the Swift–Trump lawsuit (e.g., “Biden sucks”) must be coded as 0 for both concepts.\n",
    "All coders must apply these rules strictly and consistently; do not infer meaning or rely on personal interpretation. Follow only the explicit criteria so that the coding achieves at least a 0.7 inter-rater reliability score.\n",

    "\n",
    "We had to change the prompting strategy several time to achieve better scores. We made the concepts way more specifc by providing examples for each type of comment. However, sometimes we would make the prompt more specific, but our rating would be lower. \n",

    "### A 2-3 paragraph write up reporting your results and answering your research question\n",
    "\n",
    "Through the analysis we conducted of this TikTok video, discouragement and critique of Taylor Swift suing Donald Trump appeared more substantial and frequent than explicit support for a lawsuit. The number of comments coded as supporting a lawsuit was notably lower, as people often made fun of Swift for being dramatic in the comments. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, many commenters defended Swift, framed Trump’s use of her music as distasteful, or expressed approval of the idea that she should take legal action. However, not many people expressed specific support for Trump. Pro-Trump comments were often more critical of Swift, rather than directly supportive of Trump. Many TikTok users also reacted with jokes, confusion, or off-topic comments."

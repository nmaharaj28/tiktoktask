    "               Code “1” for Concept 1 if the comment expresses any of the following: Positive support, praise, or defense of Taylor Swift, Positive descriptions of her music, character, or actions, Agreement that she should sue Trump or take legal action, Criticism of Donald Trump, his administration, or MAGA culture in a way that implies support for Swift, Emojis commonly associated with Swift fans or Democratic support (e.g., 💙 blue hearts), Mocking or dismissing Trump with the clear implication that Swift is in the right\n",
    "               Code “0” for Concept 1 if: The comment supports Trump or criticizes Swift, The comment is neutral, off-topic, unclear, sarcastic without clear direction, or contains only emojis/text like “fyp,” “lol,” “???”, The comment discusses the situation without taking a side, The comment criticizes BOTH Trump and Swift, The comment criticizes Swift fans without criticizing Trump, The comment is unrelated to the Swift/Trump debate\n",

Sarcasm must be coded based on explicit, clear wording only—not speculation If sarcasm is not obvious through wording, code 0.\n",

    "### A 2-3 paragraph write up reporting your results and answering your research question\n",
    "\n",
    "Through the analysis we conducted on this TikTok video, support for Taylor Swift appeared more substantial and frequent than explicit support for President Donald Trump. The number of comments coded as supporting Swift was notably higher than those supporting Trump. Many commenters defended Swift, framed Trump’s use of her music as distasteful, or expressed approval of the idea that she should take legal action. In contrast, pro-Trump comments were significantly fewer and tended to cluster around themes such as dismissing Swift’s reaction or framing her fans as overly dramatic. Pro-Trump comments were often more critical of Swift, rather than directly supportive of Trump. Many TikTok users also reacted with jokes, confusion, or off-topic comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of the second portion of the research question, users did not shift their attention toward other artists. Most comments maintained focus on Swift, Trump, or the controversy itself rather than drawing comparisons to other musicians. This comes as a suprise since singers like Olivia Rodrigo found themselves in similar situations. "
